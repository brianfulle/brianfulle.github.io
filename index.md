_**[Contextual Analysis of 10-Ks using NLP and relation to stock returns](report.md)**_

This report looks at the sentiments of 10-K reports, and comparing that to the returns of the stocks in the S&P 500 after the report's filing date. I picked three topics to look at (governance, supply chain, work force) and attempted to see how sentiment related to those topics in the 10-K will have an effect on the stock returns. The majority of the work considered creating the actual dataset, which includes company infomration, 10-K filing dates, returns over 10 days, and a 10 different sentiment measures. Below are the final scatterplot graphs that were created, and the link to the project report is above.

_**[Analyzing FED Announcements Dashboard](/pdf/FIN_377_Final.pdf)**_

This project investigates how financial markets respond to Federal Reserve communications through a sentiment analysis of FOMC announcements. Using sentiment dictionaries, keyword selection for multiple topics, and the OpenAI API, we analyzed FOMC statements and FOMC intermeeting minutes. After getting the sentiment measures of the documents, we scraped the returns from major stock indices (15 days before the document release and 15 minutes after) and compared that to the sentiment.

_**[FinTech Capstone Project Spring 2025](/pdf/stablecoin_report.pdf)**_

This repott explores how Google could integrate stablecoins - blockchain-based digital currencies pegged to fiat (typically USD) - into its payment infrastructure. It evaluates stablecoin use cases across Google's operations, such as:
  - Consumer transactions, including YoutubeTV and Google Play;
  - B2B transactions, like merchant payouts and supplier settlemtns;
  - Treasury management, enabling faster and cheaper global fund movements;
  - Digital wallets, such as Google Pay, for peer-to-peer and retail payments'
